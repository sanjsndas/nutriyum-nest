                NutriyumNest is dedicated to providing a nurturing online space for wholesome recipes, wellness insights, and a supportive community. These Terms are designed to ensure a positive and respectful experience for all users, outlining both your rights and responsibilities. We encourage you to read them carefully and understand their implications before engaging with our platform. Your continued use of the Service after any modifications to these Terms indicates your acceptance of the revised Terms.

Your continued use of the Service following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. It is your responsibility to check this page periodically for updates.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Changes to Terms</h3>
            <p>
                We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. We will indicate at the top of these Terms the date on which they were last updated.
            </p>
            <p>
                By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service. We understand that changes can occur, and we will always strive to communicate significant updates clearly and promptly. However, it remains your responsibility to review these Terms periodically to ensure you are aware of any modifications. Your ongoing engagement with NutriyumNest following any changes signifies your understanding and acceptance of the new conditions.

            <h3>7. Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>
            <p>
                Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance.
                <br><br>
                NutriyumNest, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that: a) the Service will function uninterrupted, secure, or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; or d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we strive to provide accurate and helpful information, NutriyumNest does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information on the Service, including recipes, nutritional data, or wellness advice. All information is for informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for professional medical, dietary, or health advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before making any changes to your diet or lifestyle, especially if you have existing health conditions.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>
                In no event shall NutriyumNest, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                This limitation of liability applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if NutriyumNest has been advised of the possibility of such damage. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, NutriyumNest's liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.
            </p>

                This indemnification obligation will survive the termination of these Terms and your use of the Service. You agree that NutriyumNest will have the right to control the defense or settlement of any claim for which you are required to indemnify NutriyumNest.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Termination</h3>
            <p>
                We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
                <br><br>
                Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
            </p>
            <p>
                NutriyumNest also reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Service, or any part thereof, at any time for any reason, with or without notice. We will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.
            </p>

            <h3>11. Governing Law</h3>
            <p>
                These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of India, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
                <br><br>
                Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.
            </p>

            <h3>12. Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>
                In the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Service, both parties agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute informally. You agree to contact NutriyumNest directly at <a href="mailto:disputes@nutriyumnest.com" class="text-berry-plum hover:underline">disputes@nutriyumnest.com</a> with a detailed description of your grievance. We will endeavor to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days of receiving your communication.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the dispute cannot be resolved informally, both parties agree to resolve any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (as amended from time to time), and the rules framed thereunder. The seat of arbitration shall be Delhi, India. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on both parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of its copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                By agreeing to these Terms, you are waiving your right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
            </p>

            <h3>13. Severability</h3>
            <p>
                If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render these Terms unenforceable or invalid as a whole. Instead, such provisions shall be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law. All other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                This ensures that even if one part of the agreement is deemed legally flawed, the core principles and remaining clauses of the Terms of Service continue to bind both parties.
            </p>

            <h3>14. Entire Agreement</h3>
            <p>
                These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and any other legal notices published by NutriyumNest on the Service, constitute the entire agreement between you and NutriyumNest concerning the Service. They supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Service. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of NutriyumNest.
            </p>
            <p>
                No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from NutriyumNest or through or from the Service shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms.
            </p>
