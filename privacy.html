            <p>
                The security of your data is paramount to us. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your Personal Data when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. These measures include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Using SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission to protect information during transit.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Restricting access to your personal data to authorized personnel only, who are bound by confidentiality obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> Collecting only the data that is necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy.</li>

            <p>

                <br><br>
                We will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes.
